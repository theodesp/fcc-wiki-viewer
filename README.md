# Free Code Camp Project: Build a Wikipedia Viewer


**Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story**: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

**User Story**: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

Hint #1: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.

Hint #2: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.

Hint #3: Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
